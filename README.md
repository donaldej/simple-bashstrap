# simple-bashstrap
A quick and easy bash bootstrap. I wanted a quick bash bootstrap to shorten the 
amount of time it required to get scripts written for whatever. I am not a bash 
expert in general, so I apologize in advance if its not great.

### **Key Features**
---
1. Simple auto generating help screen.
2. Nice terminal logging with the ability to use premade error, warning, and info
 templates or just pass it foreground and background color names for custom output.
3. A couple useful functions for text input, array manipulation and string manipulation.

### **Todo**
---
Not sure yet. Depends on what I need, when I need it and how often. Probably 
will work on making this something that can be included in a shell script as 
opposed to being more of a template for a script.
